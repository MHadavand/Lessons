    "Nearest neighbor is one of the oldest machine learning techniques that is often used for classification. The base idea is to find the closets data record(s) to a target data record based on a measure of distance. Euclidean distance is one the alternatives to define the distance which is one of the Minkowski distance ($L_p$ norms) options where p = 2.\n",

    "Nearest neighbor can also be used to identify collocated data in a cartezian framework. The idea is very simple and there are different algorithm to make the calculation fast based (e.g. Ball Tree K-d Tree)."

    "One option is the use multiple nearest neighbors (i.e. KNN) and use the majority rule decision. K-Fold cross-validation analysis can be used to select the optimal number for K.\n",
    "\n",
    "The better approach is to use the proper distance function. For example, for image classification like the MNIST example, Minkowski distances are proper choice as they are sensitive to moving/rotating the target object (e.g. hand written number) in the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tangent distance** is not sensitive to small translations and rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shape context**, can be used to handle a broader family of natural deformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another distance function that is a metric is an edit distance that is the number of insertions, deletions and substitutions to get from instance X to instance y. This kind of distance function is particularly suitable for string arrays."
